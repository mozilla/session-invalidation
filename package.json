  "description": "The Mozilla Session Invalidation tool (name subjet to change) is a solution providing Information Security teams such as Mozilla's Enterprise Information Security (EIS) with the capability to rapidly terminate the sessions of user accounts across a variety of reliant parties (RPs), i.e. services that a user may have a session on.  In doing so, a potentially compromised user account can have its access to services revoked, preventing an attacker from using a compromised account to wreak havoc.",
